<b>This is Java 8 project - it will not work with older versions of JDK!</b>

<b>To be able to run and edit this program, please follow this steps:</b><br>
1. You can use any IDE, but GUI is made in NetBeans, so you need NetBeans if you want to make any changes in it.<br>
2. All libraries and graphics are on Github - if you are using NB everything should be configured correctly by default, using other IDE's you must set libraries and run directory manually.

<b>Project goals:</b><br>
1. Creation of the most advanced, professional-looking deed planner for Wurm Online<br>
2. Access to the widest possible audience - as little platform-dependent code as possible<br>
3. The program usage should be as simple as possible<br>
4. Cooperation with other Wurm-related programs and the game itself.
